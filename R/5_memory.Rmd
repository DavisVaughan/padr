Every empty object takes 40 bytes

```{r}
object.size(seq_len(0))
```

These are metadat(4b), like type. Two pointers (2*8b) one to the next object and one to the previous one. A pointer to the attributes(8b). The length of the vector (4b) and the data are the final parts.

For small vectors are asks for a block of memory at once, because asking for memory is expensive. For larger vectors it will let the memory allocator do it. 

If objects have shared component R points to the other object, it will not copy it.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
object.size(x)
y <- list(x, x, x)
object.size(y)
```
