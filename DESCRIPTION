Version: 0.1.0
Author: Edwin Thoen
Maintainer: Edwin Thoen <edwinthoen@gmail.com>
Description: The padr package helps transforming raw datetime data to a format ready for analysis. It offers two functionalities; aggregating data to a higher level interval (thicken) and filling records where observations were absent (pad). Moreover, it offers a few functions that assist at filling missing values after padding.
